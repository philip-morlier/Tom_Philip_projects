## Our Objective
<br/>
        It is an interesting time to be alive at the least. Some would say we are learning a lot of horrible<br/>
    truths about how the world works in a time of crisis. However you may feel about the times, one thing is<br/>
    certain: there is a wealth of data out there that needs to be analyzed. Our plan is to use google trends<br/>
    to view different trends over the last [as of yet undecided amount of] months, before and after the start<br/>
    of the covid-19 [pandemic? scare? lockdowns?]. The categories we have chosen are<br/>
    [tentatively: Guns, Streaming Services, Toiletries, Groceries, Pet adoption]. We will then search<br/> 
    3 subcartegories and compare them with their category, i.e. ak-47, [gun 2], [gun 3] with guns.
    <br/>
    <br/>
        After viewing possible trends we will use google's API to build a data base which we will then use<br/>
    our data base to make our own API in flask. Finally we will use our API to visualize our data in a<br/>
    [dashboard format or interactive graph]
